# Litecoin-Grinder
The Litecoin Grinder makes mining Litecoin simple and easy.

The Litecoin Grinder was created by a human with legit programming skills who wanted to help other humans mine Litecoins easily, because mining Litecoins required a lot of technical stuff that made no sense for the average person.

May the grind be long and plentiful.

Here is Lusin's video tutorial on how to use the Litecoin Grinder. Enjoy all those legit Litecoins! https://youtu.be/4lyEszcP6rQ
